# CV-Maker-Demo
This is application for making CV. Nice designs of CV are in general expensive, so I decided to make CV maker as a project. If you want to use this, clone this project, then add your photo and rename it to profile.jpg. Additionally, since it is demo version you will have to change HTML, so it matches your skills and projects. In future, I will make CV maker where you can dynamically add your projects and information about you. After you are done with editing, just type "node index.js" and pdf file will apear in your folder.
